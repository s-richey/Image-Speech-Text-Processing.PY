This is the submission for a project in Introduction to Modern Scientific Computing (IMSC) at Mississippi State University 

After spending months coding in MATLAB, this is the first Python project for the class.
Note that speech2txt is written completely from scrath while pdfim2txt was given structure in the model code

Other files include the images and .wav files that I used for testing. The speech2txt program also works with mic inputs.
